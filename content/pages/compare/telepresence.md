          - We switched from Telepresence to mirrord a few months ago due to instability and breaking updates in Telepresence. <span class="text-primary">Wish I had known about mirrord before.</span>

          - <span class="text-primary">Fantastic plugin</span>. Being able to run your service "locally in the cluster" through the click of one button is powerful. I have started to roll it out to the whole dev team. Also shout-out to the devs for being really helpful, had a very specific issue because of the way I set up my pods and it got fixed next day.

          - One underappreciated feature of mirrord is that in my experience it <span class="text-primary">"just works"</span> while I always have to spend way too much time configuring telepresence.

          - mirrord from MetalBear <span class="text-primary">really is magic</span> Developing Robusta Dev locally used to be a pain. Robusta needs to access Prometheus in-cluster, to receive events on push with webhooks, etc.
          - But with mirrord <span class="text-primary">it just works</span>. Seriously magical experience.

          - I'm using it for around a month now. mirrord enabled me to <span class="text-primary">easily connect my app into my k8s cluster</span> and use the system as it in the k8s environment with ease. I could just forget running docker on my machine and use the dev k8s environment to run my code with minimal configuration and work.

          - After trying Telepresence, Gefyra and other, I can say with confidence this is by far, a surprise tool. <span class="text-primary">It's like magic</span>, an out-of-the-box experience like no other. Bootstrapping our development cycle, dropping the use of "local-dev", comes with fine-grained configuration. <span class="text-primary">A real gem</span>!

          - I tried using mirrord for Agones GameServer. Unlike Telepresence, which does various services, you can directly enter the Pod, so you can mirror the communication! <span class="text-primary">wonderful</span>

          - Well on this unrelated occasion - thank you for mirrord! A <span class="text-primary">life saver</span> when writing controllers for k8s and need the cluster context. I don't know if usecase is common, but it fixed me :)

          - An <span class="text-primary">amazing product</span>. For the first time I was able to debug my kubernetes pods, and all in such easy configuration and process. <span class="text-primary">Recommended!!! </span>Looking forward for the next releases

          - This is a <span class="text-primary">very very useful plugin</span> that will allow you to debug your code locally but in the context of your k8s cluster using real traffic from the cluster in a frictionless way. IMHO it's also <span class="text-primary">superior (in terms of ease of use/value) to other solutions out there</span>. 5/5
