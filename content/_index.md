<h2>The <span id="typewriter"></span> route to pre-production testing</h2>

By mirroring traffic to and from your machine, mirrord surrounds your local service with a mirror image of its cloud environment.

- <b>Speed up your feedback loop:</b> Test your service in the cloud from your local machine, without CI or deployment
- <b>Lightweight:</b> Get up and running in seconds 
- <b>Safe:</b> Concurrently test on the same cloud environmen

<!-- ## Why deploy to staging when you can...
**not** deploy to staging?

By mirroring traffic to and from your machine, ***mirrord*** surrounds your local sergvice with a mirror image of its cloud environment.

### No more:
 - Mocking up databases/traffic/configuration
 - Waiting for the CI to run
 - Breaking the shared environment for everyone -->

<!-- ### Stop 🛑✋

- Mocking databases/traffic/configuration
- Waiting for the CI to run
- Breaking the shared environment for everyone

### Start ▶️
- Running your service locally, with remote service's context
- Receiving mirrored (duplicated) traffic in real time
- Having the same environment variables the remote service has
- Accessing resources available to the remote context such as databases, managed services, etc. -->
