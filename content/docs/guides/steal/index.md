By default, mirrord mirrors all incoming traffic into the remote target, and sends a copy to your local process. This is useful when you want the remote target to answer requests, keeping the remote environment completely agnostic to your local code. However, sometimes you do want to test out how your local code responds to requests; or maybe your process writes to a database when receiving a request, and you want to avoid duplicate records (one from your local code, one from the remote target).
In these cases, you probably want to steal traffic instead of mirroring it. When you steal traffic, your local process is the one answering the requests, and not the remote target. This guide will show you how to do that.

## Stealing all of the remote target's traffic
If you want all traffic arriving at the remote target to be redirected to your local process, change the `feature.network.incoming` configuration to `steal`:

```json
{
  "feature": {
    "network": {
      "incoming": "steal"
    }
  }
}
```

Run your process with mirrord using the steal configuration, then send a request to the remote target. The response you receive will have been sent by the local process. If you're using one of our IDE extensions, set a breakpoint in the function handling the request - your request should hang when the breakpoint is hit and until you continue the process.

## Stealing only a subset of the remote target's traffic
For incoming HTTP traffic, mirrord also supports stealing a subset of the remote target's traffic. You can do this by specifying a filter on either an HTTP header or path.
To specify a filter on a header, use the `feature.network.incoming.http_filter.header_filter` configuration:

```json
{
  "feature": {
    "network": {
      "incoming": {
        "mode": "steal",
        "http_filter": {
          "header_filter": "X-My-Header: my-header-value",
          "ports": [80, 8080]
        },
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `feature.network.incoming.http_filter.ports` configuration lets mirrord know which ports are listening to HTTP traffic and should be filtered. It defaults to `[80, 8080]`.

To specify a filter on a path, use the `feature.network.incoming.http_filter.path_filter` configuration:

```json
{
  "feature": {
    "network": {
      "incoming": {
        "mode": "steal",
        "http_filter": {
          "path_filter": "my/path",
          "ports": [80, 8080]
        },
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that both `header_filter` and `path_filter` take regex value, so for example `"header_filter": "X-Header-.+: header-value-.+"` would work.
